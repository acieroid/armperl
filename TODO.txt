Deleted:
  - obligatory parenthesis and no more ε in funcall args
  - removed the ε from <funcall args>
  - <expr> = <expr>: better compatibility

Bugs:
  - jumps.pl does not evaluate correctly, but compiles correctly
  - test lib.pl does not work
  - Add functions (number of parameters) to the symbol table
