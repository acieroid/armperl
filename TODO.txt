Deleted:
  - obligatory parenthesis and no more ε in funcall args
  - removed the ε from <funcall args>
  - <expr> = <expr>: better compatibility
  - Add a cleaner interface (like gcc, pass the .pl file and it generates the .s)
  - global.pl example segfaults
  - jumps.pl does not evaluate correctly, but compiles correctly
  - Lexer problem: it lexes substr as SUB str (it seems so)
  - test lib.pl does not work
