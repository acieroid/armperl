ARMPerl - Compiler for a subset of Perl

University Project for the course "Introduction to Language Theory and
Compilation" (INFO-F-403) at ULB.

Authors: Vadim Baele and Quentin Stievenart

* Compilation
To compile the project, you need OCaml installed. Any version will do,
as long as you also have ocamlbuild installed.

Just run =make= to compile the compiler.
* Testing
To compile a Perl program, run =./main.byte -i foo.pl -o foo.s=. You
can then use the =lib=, =obj= and =try= rules with =make= to build an
executable and execute it on an Android device, for example: =make lib
&& make obj && make try=.

For more information, see =./main.byte -help=.
